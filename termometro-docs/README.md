## EL TERMOMETRO DEL AUTOESTIMA

This is an App which can show you how your kids and yourself are feeling. It is more like how do you love yourself everyday, for example in the morning and then in the evening.

Being concious of how you are feeling is the best way to prevent depressions and feeling empty with yourself. Some adults can control and analize how they're feeling but what about the kids?

Are you getting sure how is your kid feeling everyday? Probably is not your fault becouse sometimes it's hard for them to tell you about they're feelings. So, this is a great way for them to tell you how are they feeling.

this exercise can be so useful not only to see how your kid is feeling, you can also compare with all the members of your family, and if one of you are getting a low score lately, why don't you take a moment, sit with them, and talk about how they're deeply feeling lately and what worries him.

HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!
